[Bluesky](https://bsky.social)-powered [NWS](https://weather.gov) warning bots.

These bots are almost identical mirrors of the Twitter NWS Tornado, Severe
Tstorm and Flash Flood bots. However, they do not interact with the Twitter bots
in any manner; they get their data from the source (the NWS API). Because of
this, there are slight differences in the functionality. They also don't
generate images of the warning polygons because text, although it may be
limiting, can be shared faster and easier.

## About these tools (and a disclaimer)

These tools are just extensions of the
[National Weather Service](https://weather.gov)'s tools. None of these are
"professional grade": what that means is you should not use these as your sole
source of information, **especially in a dangerous situation**. They are meant
for informational purposes only. They can be used for future reference, sharing,
and following along with severe weather events as they happen.

_**Please refer to the [National Weather Service](https://weather.gov) for
time-critical information. Time is the most valuable thing when your life is in
danger.**_
